    "When the moon perches high in the night, it heralds the coming of the three. Prepare your weapons, gather your gold, and decide: fight against the enemy or surrender without regret. Their legend, like a sickness, spreads across the cosmos, proclaiming their unyielding might. People whisper in fear, avoiding the invocation of their names: \"Beware the three brothers clad in gold and blood, for they arrive in the depths of night.\"",

"Thus, their legend lives on, and their story is retold-those abandoned brothers bound not by shared blood, but by equally shared loathing and a common goal: to live undefeated and to never be wronged again.
That's how the story unfolds, and that's how the horror endures.
The story of the three moves onwards."
