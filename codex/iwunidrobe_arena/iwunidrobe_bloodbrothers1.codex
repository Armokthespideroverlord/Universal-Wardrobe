    "An Apex escapes his tyrannical home, endowed with great strength and ardent purpose but lacking enthusiasm for ideology.
An Avian flees her dogmatic domain, blessed with exceptional sight and flight but valued only for the blood she could shed for their god.
A Human abandons his righteous home, driven by a thirst for violence and exuberance for chaos, an outcast in his peaceful society.",

"Rejected, wronged, and despised, they walk forlorn. Bound by Destiny, they find in their pain a shared fury. Together, they form a pact-a pact of blood: \"From now on, we remain as one, and soon, glory and might shall be our own!\"
Thus, their story begins, and thus, the horror is born.
From these three, their tale continues."
