  "description" : "After dedicating hundreds of hours, I can finally present to you: [b] Universal Wardrobe! [/b]\nThis mod adds dozens of unique outfits and variants of both new and vanilla outfits, mostly to give a lot of uniqueness to the npcs of the game. You’ll be able to get these new clothing pieces in chests all around the universe, some of them well kept in the brand-new costume boxes. You will also find a new crafting table: the [b] Customization Desk [/b], where you can customize, combine and create clothing items along with new dyes.\n\n[h2] CONTENTS [/h2]\n[list]\n[*] New crafting table: Customization Desk.\n[*] 16 new Back items.\n[*] 111 new Head items, along with 39 new variants (vanilla and modded).\n[*] 30 new Chest items, along with 84 new variants (vanilla and modded).\n[*] 30 new Leg items, along with 11 new variants (vanilla and modded).\n[*] 40 new costume boxes.\n[*] 5 new codexes.\n[*] 44 new dyes.\n[/list]\n\n[h2] MOD COMPATIBILITY [/h2]\n[b] Inbuilt: [/b]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1666272764] Green’s Dye Suit [/url]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=734855062] Wardrobe Interface [/url]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=733665104] Spawnable Item Pack [/url]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3060280131] Book of Spirits [/url]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2422986190] Futara’s Fullbright Shader [/url]\n\n[h2] Credits [/h2]\n-[b] Armok [/b] : A big thanks to him for helping me refine the writing of the codexes and item descriptions, while also making helpful suggestions for the mod.\n\n[h2] So… what’s next? [/h2]\nI’ve been working on this mod since January of 2023. Not that I spent 2 whole years doing this mod, I had been making… other stuff, yet this mod took the longest time to develop. I want to take a good break from this mod, and honestly, I don’t think next updates will add 300 clothing items approx, most of them will be adding small batches of costume sets. There’s still a lot of work to do. I hope you like it, and remember to report any bug, crash or feedback you have :)",
